## Quiz board project

##  Project requirements
As a user, I would like have the freedom to choose the answers to a question. This means you will create  questions and the provide multiple choice to those questions. Lets take an example:

What is the other name for JavaScript?

* ECMAScript
* Vue
* I don't know

Break the program down into simple, individual behaviors with input/output examples. Begin with the simplest possible behavior. List these behaviors (also known as "specs" or "specifications") in the project's README.md file.

| Behaviour          | User input        |    Result                                         |
| ------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Checks if answers given by user are correct              | Correct answer   |     5mks awarded                  | 
| Checks if answers given by user are incorrect.    |   Incorrect answer                |      Null              |
